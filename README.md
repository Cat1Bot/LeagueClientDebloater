> [!NOTE]  
> This repository is no longer supported due to fundamental limitations in hooking the League Client UX.  
> Due of how the client plugin system loads, this plugin cannot fully debloat the client on first load, which defeats its core purpose.  
> Despite attempts, maintaining and fixing these inherent UX hooking issues proved unfeasible and unstable, and I cant be bothered anymore with this plugin.

> For a reliable and user-friendly solution, please use [League Patch Collection](https://github.com/Cat1Bot/league-patch-collection) instead.  
> It is an external mod menu that works 100% of the time without bricking client or causing other unintended issues.  
> Features include GUI with customizable options such as disable Vanguard, auto-accept, dodge, debloater, and much more.  
> It also supports the Riot Client and future Riot titles like 2XKO.
